# JavaScript Bangkok Scholarship

We at JavaScript Bangkok believe in diversity, the equality, thus we welcome everyone and anyone to participate in the growing JavaScript community in Thailand and around the world.

## What is the scholarship?

People who get selected for a scholarship are eligible to receive one free ticket to the conference. We also provide financial support for travel and accommodation up to 2000 THB.

We provide the scholarship to support folks in underrepresented groups. Sometimes people from other non-tech industries would interest in tech conferences but since they have no prior experience about tech conferences they might not be convinced the ticket price are worth spending. Also most conferences are often held in the capital city like Bangkok, people from different provinces might find it uncomfortable to travel to Bangkok solely just to attend the conference.

We want to close this gap and made quality conferences accessible and available to more people. That's why we're introducing the Scholarship program

## Who can apply?

Anyone from an underrepresented group is free to apply for the scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Women
- People of color
- LGBTQIA+ people
- Disabled people
- Students
- People with non-tech professions
- People facing economic or social hardships.

The selection committee will consist of JavaScript Bangkok organizers.

## I’m not a member of an underrepresented group, can I apply?

We will likely not consider you in our selection process.

## How much do I get for financial support?

We will cover up to 2000 THB for each person (Please prepare as many proofs as possible e.g. receipt, picture of taxi meter, plane ticket)

## When will I get the reimbursement?

When you arrive at the conference after registration bring all proofs to our staff and we'll give you the reimbursement in cash.

## What are the selection criteria?

We are prioritizing individuals from underrepresented groups and individuals who are expected to benefit the most from attending JavaScript Bangkok 1.0.0
